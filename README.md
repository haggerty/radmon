# radmon
PHENIX dosimeter analysis

The last set of plots were made with plotradmon.C with ROOT 5.34.36 at RCF.  The radmon table in the daq database is accessible at RCF
and 1008, but probably not much of anywhere else.  The scaler database used in some of the functions may have been lost when phnxdb1
failed, although the raw data itself could still be extracted from the SYBASE database used by CAD for RHIC data.
